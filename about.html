  <P>
    I've got the idea of this Website/Project while working at home, 
    as I used to keep records of my Elder Sister's earnings/Salary. 
    During that time, I regularly face difficulties in keeping records of data properly, as writing names & 
    calculating data wasn't possible on calculator or any single app like notes writer.
    Although, there were so many apps, but I didn't knew about any of them.
    So, that's how I thought to turn my difficulty into opportunity, and that's how I got the idea. 
    Thanks for reading!!
  </P>
